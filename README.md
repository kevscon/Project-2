# Forecasting Independent Film Performance

For the past five years (2013-2017), the winners for Best Picture at the Academy Awards have been independent films. The cultural significance of these movies will live on long after we've forgotten the intricate plot of the latest Avengers flick. While the incentive for creating independent films may not be to have top-grossing blockbusters at the box office, sufficient revenue is needed to motivate producers to finance and ultimately create them. Exploring patterns of successful independent movies may be one method to help filmmakers connect with their intended audience.

## Summary
Based on trends in recent years, the financial performance of independent films was predicted using a linear regression model. After model development, specific features leading to good or poor performance were identified.
